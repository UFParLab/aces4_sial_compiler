This it the GIT for the SIAL compiler sources.  

On the HPC center, this is /home/basbas/compiler.git (or /home/basbas/compiler.git/edu.ufl.cise.sial.compiler)
On pc-358, this is mirrored in the eclipse workspace in C:\sanders\sial_compiler_git\compiler\edu.ufl.cise.sial.compiler


To develop and run on the HPC center, load java 7

module load java


From the top directory (the one containing bin  build.xml  lib  README  src) 



To build the sial compiler (this does not run lpg, just recompiles the java), use the ant builder (similar to make)

ant

Note that the ant script is in the file build.xml and has other targets, such as ant clean




To run the sial compiler from this directory

java -classpath lib/*:bin sial.compiler.SialCompiler  -sp PATH TO SIAL FILES FILE





Release notes:

It is possible that the equals and hashcode methods have not been designed perfectly for some of the AST nodes.
